## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling to consolidate sales data thus enabling analytical reporting and informed decision making.

**Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (CRM and ERP) provided as csv files
**Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
**Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user friendly data model designed for analytical queries
**Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only - historization of details not required
**Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data to support business stakeolders and analytics teams
